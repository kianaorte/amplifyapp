        <p>
          In my final year of university, I had the pleasure to work with
          Sisters United as a Full-Stack Developer. They needed somewhere to
          post helpful resources and advertise their events which were targeted
          toward young women from low income families. After gathering their
          requirements over the course of multiple meetings and iterations, we
          decided a web application was that they wanted.

        <h4>Designing Phase</h4>
        <p>
          I was first tasked with creating a design for the application. I first
          created a low-fidelity wireframe, so we could sort out how they would
          like a user to interact with the application. From then I started
          working on a high fidelity using Adobe XD, which allowed the client to
          directly interact with the design to see if they were happy with
          everything. Insert pictures underneath pls ðŸ¥´

        <p>These are the final design which were created using</p>
